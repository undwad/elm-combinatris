# elm-combinatris
This game is a [**Combinatris**](http://dirk.rave.org/combinatris/how-to-play.html)
clone coded in [**Elm**](http://elm-lang.org/) language.

Unlike the original game, expressions don't reduce completely at once,
but step by step, so that you could stop infinite loops.
Scoring also is slightly different but intuitive.

Use arrow keys or screen buttons to play the game.

The game is open source on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/undwad/elm-combinatris).
