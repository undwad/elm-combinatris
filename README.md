This project is a [**Combinatris**](http://dirk.rave.org/combinatris/how-to-play.html) clone coded in [**Elm**](http://elm-lang.org/) language.

The game contains combinatory logic language editor, where one can create his own set of combinators to play with or examine one of the well-known computational systems:  [**SKI**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus) or [**BCKW**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B,_C,_K,_W_system).

Read more about combinatory logic in [**Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic).
